// An app is considered "owned" if there's any non-expired license that grants access
// to it: either its own package's license, or any DLC of it (e.g. for free-to-start
// titles like Diablo IV where the actual purchase is a separate "Standard Edition"
// DLC sub that unlocks the base appid). Without the DLC arm, F2P-with-paid-DLC games
// disappear after the user's free-weekend sub on the base appid expires, even though
// they still own the game via the DLC entitlement.
//
// The two arms are split into two separate EXISTS clauses on purpose: most apps will
// be decided by the first (own-license) arm, which is an O(1) PK lookup on
// steam_license. SQLite short-circuits the second (DLC scan) arm in that common case,
// keeping load times comparable to the original PR #985 query for large libraries.
//
// When :includeExpired is 1, the license predicate is bypassed entirely, surfacing
// apps that are normally hidden (used by the "Expired" library filter for diagnostics).
