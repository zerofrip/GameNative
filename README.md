# GameNative

This fork now integrates Mesa driver distribution for GameNative, including manifest entries for `freedreno`, `panvk`, and `virpipe` GameNative-ready packages.

GameNative allows you to play games you own on Steam, Epic and GOG directly on Android devices, with cloud saves.

## Building
### IF YOU JUST WANT TO USE THE APP, PLEASE SEE THE HOW TO USE SECTION ABOVE. THIS IS ONLY NEEDED IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE FOR DEVELOPMENT.
1. I use a normal build in Android studio. Hit me up if you can't figure out how to build.
2. **SteamGridDB API Key (Optional):** To enable automatic fetching of game images for Custom Games, add your SteamGridDB API key to `local.properties`:
   ```
   STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Get your API key from: https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences
   If the API key is not configured, the app will log a message but continue to work normally without fetching images.

## Analytics & Privacy

GameNative uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for anonymous analytics. No personal information is ever collected — no names, emails, IPs, or device identifiers.

**Always collected** (to improve game compatibility):
- Game launch, close, and exit events (game name, store, session length, average FPS, container config)
- Game install, cancel, and uninstall events

This data helps us understand which games work, how well they perform, and automatically apply known-good configurations for future users. It cannot identify you.

**Optional** (can be disabled in Settings > Info > Usage Analytics):
- Feature usage (on-screen keyboard, controller, HUD, control editor)
- Login success/failure events
- Recommendation interactions
- App lifecycle events (foreground/background)
- Cloud sync events
